# Beam Soundly Interactive
The Interactive Sound Board for Beam

## Description
Not all the interactive streams on Beam have to be playing a game!
Want to get your viewers interacting with you while you stream?
Let them spice up the stream by triggering sound effects of your choice!

## Installation
There are currently no releases available but if you wanted, you could
clone or fork this repo and compile the code from scratch. Beam Soundly Interactive
is built with node.js and electron! Checkout the package.json file for dependencies!

The Interactive App on Beam has yet to be published and I am looking for suggestions
on different states I should have to allow for different global cooldowns and spark costs.
